# Downsampler

This was created in response to a challenge from an employer. The task was to create a program that could take an n-dimensional array of numbers and "downsample" it into
a new, smaller array. A single downsampling would halve the extents each of the dimensions (to a minimum of 1), but the system must be able to downsample any number of times.
The program also had to be multithreaded. The in-line comments explain my methodology. See the "Remarks" file for information on how the program performed.
